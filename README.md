# gIRCbnc

gIRCbnc is an IRC bouncer. It is very new and will take a while to become usable at all. Issues and PRs welcomed!

I'm aiming for this to roughly act like ZNC. Not to take the same config files, but to use a similar command-line output and use similar methods when controlling it via IRC. At least to start off with.
